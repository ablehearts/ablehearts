## Meet Mary & Lydia ❤️

[AbleHearts](https://ablehearts-org.vercel.app/) was born out of love and necessity — to help **Mary Nyaboke Onchangu** and her daughter **Lydia Kwamboka Onchangu**, who live with physical challenges, share their journey and receive support from kind hearts around the world.

Through this platform, you can give what you are blessed to have — time, resources, or donations — ensuring Mary, Lydia, and many more in the global village live with dignity and hope.
